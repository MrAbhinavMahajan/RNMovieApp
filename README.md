### JSX

JSX is the syntax extension for JavaScript that lets you write HTML-like markup inside a JavaScript file.
The root element returned by a component, should be a single element.
Using curly brackets { } we can create a portal from JSX to Javascript Expression.

### Fragment

### TanStack Query

TanStack Query provides a high advantage in data fetching, caching, background updates and more.

- It manages loading, error, and data states.
- It manages refetchOnWindowFocus, retry when the network request fails and staleTime.

### JWT Token ( Javascript Web Token )

- JWT tokens are signed so TMDB services are protected from token alteration
- End users are protected with token validation
- End users approve the application request token
- Encryption can be AES with a 256 bits key (token is HS256 signed with a 256 bit key).

### Zustand (State Management + MMKV Storage)

Zustand is a small, fast and scaleable state-management solution for React applications with minimal boilerplate.

### MMKV Storage

MMKV is a Memory Map Key Value Storage.
(30% faster than AsyncStorage, and is developed by WeChat)

- Encryption
  - Keychain on iOS
  - Keystore on android (API 23 and above)
- Synchronous
- Faster performance
